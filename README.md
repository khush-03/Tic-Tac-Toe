# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C++. The game is played on the console, allowing two players to take turns and compete against each other.

### Features
-Two-player gameplay: The game supports two human players who take turns marking their chosen positions on the game board.
-Board visualization: The current state of the game board is displayed after each move, allowing players to see the game's progress.
-Input validation: Player input is validated to ensure that it is within the valid range and that the chosen position is unoccupied.
-Win detection: The game automatically detects a win condition and declares the winner.
-Tie condition: If no player wins and all positions are occupied, the game ends in a tie.

### How to Run
To run the Tic Tac Toe game, follow these steps:

-Clone this repository or download the source code files.
-Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
-Run the compiled executable.
Example (using g++ compiler):

### How to Play
1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Each player takes turns entering their move by selecting the row and column numbers of the desired position.
3. The first player is assigned 'X,' and the second is assigned 'O'.
4. To make a move, enter the row and column numbers separated by a space or a comma (e.g., 1, 2 or 1,2).
5. The game will validate the input and display the updated game board.
6. Keep playing until a player wins or the game ends in a tie.
